@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="Here the actual momentum of the nucleus is $P_N=m_Nv_N$ but since $m_N$ is decoupled in HSET, it can not appear anywhere in our calculations. "}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="Actually in the HSET side only energy conservation is kept, but for formality we write four momentum in the diagram. So we may wrote $k$ on the HSET side but what we meant was $k^0$. "}
