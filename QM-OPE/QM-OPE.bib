  title       = {Correction to Solution of Dirac Equation},
  abstract    = {Using the China unitary principle to test the Dirac theoryfor the hydrogen atomic spectrum shows that the standard Dirac function withthe Dirac energy levels is only one the formal solutions of theDirac-Coulomb equation, which conceals some pivotal mathematicalcontradictions. The theorem of existence of solution of the Dirac equationrequires an important modification to the Dirac angular momentum constantthat was defined by Dirac's algebra. It derives the modified radial Diracequation which has the consistency solution involving the quantum neutronradius and the neutron binding energy. The inevitable solution for otheratomic energy states is only equivalent to the Bohr solution. It concludesthat the Dirac equation is more suitable to describe the structure ofneutron. How to treat the difference between the unitary energy levels andthe result of the experimental observation of the atomic spectrums for thehydrogen atom needs to be solved urgently.},

  title       = {New exact solution of Dirac-Coulomb equation with exact boundary condition},
  abstract    = {It usually writes the boundary condition of the wave equation in the Coulomb field as a rough form without considering the size of the atomic nucleus. The rough expression brings on that the solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation and the Dirac equation with the Coulomb potential are divergent at the origin of the coordinates, also the virtual energies, when the nuclear charges number Z > 137, meaning the original solutions do not satisfy the conditions for determining solution. Any divergences of the wave functions also imply that the probability density of the meson or the electron would rapidly increase when they are closing to the atomic nucleus. What it predicts is not a truth that the atom in ground state would rapidly collapse to the neutron-like. We consider that the atomic nucleus has definite radius and write the exact boundary condition for the hydrogen and hydrogen-like atom, then newly solve the radial Dirac-Coulomb equation and obtain a new exact solution without any mathematical and physical difficulties. Unexpectedly, the K value constructed by Dirac is naturally written in the barrier width or the equivalent radius of the atomic nucleus in solving the Dirac equation with the exact boundary condition, and it is independent of the quantum energy. Without any divergent wave function and the virtual energies, we obtain a new formula of the energy levels that is different from the Dirac formula of the energy levels in the Coulomb field.},
