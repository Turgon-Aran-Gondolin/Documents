This directory contains basic routines to start developping 
a code for simulating the phi**4 theory with the HMC algorithm
as described in the lecture notes.

To compile use "make". The (very rudimentary) program is run with

phi4 infile

List of program files:

phi4.c    : main program
lattice.h : contains global variables, the field and its dimensions
hopping.c : initializes the hopping field
ranlxd.c  : Luescher's random number generator
